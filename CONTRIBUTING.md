# Contributing

## Project Status

Project launched and stable. Treat as version `2.0.0`.

## Contribution Guidelines

Please read this section for guidance on how to contribute to this project. While full documentation is not yet available, contributors are encouraged to help develop it. You're welcome to contribute in any way â€” whether through code, documentation, or feedback.

Our workflow is similar to the typical GitHub project's workflow. To properly submit a contribution or pull request, follow these guidelines:
- Create an issue that describes your change
- Fork the repository
- Work on changes within your fork: fix a bug or add a new feature
- Test your changes thoroughly, and include your tests in your fork
- Commit and push changes to your fork
- Create a Pull Request on GitHub to merge your fork into the main repo
- Reference your PR in the related issue
- Review and address comments on your PR
- Once your changes are merged, delete the PR branch

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure you have tested your changes and that they follow the guidelines above. By submitting a pull request, you represent that you have the right to license your contribution to the project and the community under the [project licence](LICENSE).

We utilise various bots and status checks to help with this, so do follow the comments they leave and their "Details" links, respectively. In addition, make sure to also review comments left by maintainers. The key point of our workflow that is not covered by a bot or status check is:
- All discussions that are not directly related to the code in the pull request should happen within the issue or GitHub Discussions.


## Setting Expectations

Due to the fact that this project is independently maintained, we unfortunately can make no guarantees as to if or when we will get around to reviewing your pull request. If no one has done a review or responded to changes made because of a "changes requested" review, please feel free to email vihaan.s.anand@gmail.com to ask if someone could take a look at your pull request.

## Code of Conduct

All interactions for this project are covered by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Everyone is expected to be open, considerate, and respectful of others no matter their position within the project.

## Thank you!

Thanks for contributing to the maintenance of the project! Even if your contribution is not ultimately accepted, the fact you put time and effort into helping out is greatly appreciated.
