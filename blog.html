                                                        <p>I had my third debate tournament of the year yesterday. This is the third consecutive tournament where I have won the top award! My first tournament was on 20 Sept, the <a href="https://www.tabroom.com/index/tourn/index.mhtml?tourn_id=30122" style="background-color: #48484a;">Stephen Stewart Invitational</a>, where I went undefeated. Last Saturday, I won Gold at the <a href="http://forensicstournament.net/oak/24" style="background-color: #48484a;">NOF Oak Invitational</a>. Yesterday's tournament was the <a href="https://www.tabroom.com/index/tourn/index.mhtml?tourn_id=33000" style="background-color: #48484a;">James Logan Tournament</a>, in which I won all 4 of my rounds! This is an accomplishment I never imagined being able to achieve. Thank you to Athens Debate for helping me on this journey!</p>

                                                        <p>One of my latest projects is called <span class="code-inline" style="background-color: #48484a;">vedder</span>, a Python library named after a portmanteau of "Vihaan" and "header". This library is essentially an all-purpose library that imports a bunch of useful other libraries, and defines a bunch of commonly used code snippets as functions, to save space in writing code. To contribute, simply send a pull request on the GitHub, linked below. I'll be posting the latest updates here.</p>
